"""
  This script will automatically connect to the NOAA ParallelWorks gateway to retrieve
  information about the current clusters using the user's API key.

  Critical files that must exist:

    $HOME/.ssh/pw_api.key - this file must contain the API key in the first and only
                            line.  Treat this file as any secure file and place in
                            .ssh directory.  Change permissions to mode 600.

  New files created:
    $HOME/.hosts - this is a new file created every time the script is run.
                   Do not modify this file externally as any change will be
                   lost.  If no active clusters exists, the file will be created
                   with one commented line.  For the hosts to be recognized,
                   the HOSTALIASES environment variable must point to this
                   file (i.e. export HOSTALIASES=$HOME/.hosts).
